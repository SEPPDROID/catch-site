# seppjm.com website

my personal website, for if i ever need it. Build on the [skeleton boilerplate](http://getskeleton.com) (Skeleton 2.0.4) [(github link)](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton). It's basic and empty for now.

## Get started:

I will add a `Clean` folder that will contain skeleton and my modifications for use as a template. 
You can find the download in the [releases tab](https://github.com/SEPPDROID/seppjm-com/releases/latest)

## Licensing

Feel free to use, just make sure to keep all licensing in place.
